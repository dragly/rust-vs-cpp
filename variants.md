# Variants

Create a function that accepts a "command" that can be one of these three types, each with
a respective action:

- a message that is printed to screen
- two numbers that are multipled and then printed
- the status OK, which prints "Everything will be alright"

The Command needs to be a type of its own so that parts of the code
can be agnostic to the underlying type of command.
